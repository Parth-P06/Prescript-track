# Prescription Tracker

## Introduction

The **Prescription Tracker** is a decentralized application (dApp) built on the Aptos blockchain designed to securely store and verify prescriptions. This smart contract allows doctors to create and issue digital prescriptions for patients, with features to validate the authenticity and expiration status of the prescriptions. By leveraging the blockchain, the Prescription Tracker provides an immutable and transparent record of prescriptions, improving patient safety and healthcare efficiency.

### Key Features:
- **Create Prescriptions**: Doctors can create prescriptions for patients, associating them with specific medications and validity periods.
- **Verify Prescriptions**: Anyone can verify whether a prescription is valid and hasn't expired by checking the blockchain.
- **Patient-Centric**: Prescriptions are stored under the patient's address, ensuring privacy and control over their health records.
- **Immutable Records**: All prescriptions are stored in an immutable ledger, ensuring data integrity.

## Vision

The vision of the **Prescription Tracker** is to modernize prescription management through the use of blockchain technology. By making prescription data transparent, secure, and easily accessible, the platform aims to:
- **Reduce prescription fraud** by providing an immutable record that can be publicly verified.
- **Ensure patient safety** by enabling real-time verification of prescription validity and expiration status.
- **Increase trust and accountability** between patients, doctors, and pharmacies through transparent, decentralized records.
- **Simplify the process** of storing and managing prescriptions without relying on paper-based systems.

## Future Goals

The **Prescription Tracker** project has several exciting future goals:
1. **Integration with Healthcare Systems**: Expand the system to integrate with healthcare platforms, enabling seamless sharing of prescriptions between doctors, pharmacies, and patients.
2. **Automatic Notifications**: Build functionality for sending alerts when a prescription is close to expiration or needs renewal.
3. **Pharmacy Verification**: Allow pharmacies to access the system and verify prescriptions before dispensing medications, further reducing errors and fraud.
4. **Secure Patient Access**: Implement secure mechanisms for patients to review and manage their prescriptions on a private and user-controlled platform.
5. **Interoperability**: Extend the platform to support multi-chain integration, enabling prescriptions to be verified across different blockchain ecosystems.
6. **Prescription History**: Add the ability to track a complete history of all prescriptions for a given patient over time, aiding in better long-term healthcare management.
